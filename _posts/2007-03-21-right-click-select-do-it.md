Two months ago I left Cincom, to reset and refresh a number of things in my work and life. For those few who might care, so far it's been working out great. Neat things to write about come up like never before, and this looks like the perfect time for a new blog unaffiliated with any particular company or product.

Many thanks to [Bob Westergaard](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/bobw/blogView) for helping me brainstorm the idea of a sufficiently non-committal and yet vaguely relevant title. I like how 3 + 4 and [the magical number 7](http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/) are related to my interest and involvement with languages and interfaces. They are the creations different and yet very much alike in being two of the many things that try and often fail [to make us smart](http://www.amazon.com/Things-That-Make-Smart-Attributes/dp/0201626950).
