Just a few months ago I never would have thought I'd work on anything other than Newspeak for the foreseeable future. Working with [Gilad](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/), [Peter](http://digital-sushi.org/), and others was a fantastic experience, and building a programming platform almost from scratch without political and marketing baggage attached was not a job you find every day on monster.com. But it turns out sometimes the foreseeable future [runs out](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/11/we-have-good-news-and-we-have-bad-news.html) sooner than you expect.

The end of full-time Newspeak work is a sad thing, but I'm not writing this to cry over spilt milk. They say new beginnings bring new opportunities, and this is how I want to look at it. I have just finished my first week working for Google.
