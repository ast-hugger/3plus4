About a month ago [Gilad](http://gbracha.blogspot.com/) gave a talk at the University of Potsdam about our work. The video of the talk is now [available online](http://www.tele-task.de/page50_lecture3490.html). I have been quiet for quite a while busy with our UI framework and environment (Brazil and Hopscotch), so this is a chance to see some of it in action. I hope to eventually find more time to tell about it here, but for now feel free to leave a comment with any questions and I'll do my best to answer them.
