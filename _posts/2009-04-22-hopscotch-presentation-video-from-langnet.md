Gilad gave a talk about Hopscotch last week at lang.net 09. In his blog post about it he modestly speaks in detail only about the talks of others, but since his is the first properly recorded demo of Hopscotch [available online](http://langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/08-GiladBracha-Hopscotch.html), I want to specially mention it here. It features the latest and the greatest version of the tools, so it's even better than what could be seen at Smalltalk Solutions, WASDeTT and ECOOP last year.

**Update:** A non-Silverlight (WMV) version is available [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/F/0/BF0DAE51-F096-4DB4-8707-ACBDB7680BC0/08-GiladBracha-Hopscotch.wmv).
