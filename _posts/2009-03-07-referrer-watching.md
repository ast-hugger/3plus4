I've just discovered that JÃ¶rg Mittag was kind enough to mention Newspeak, Brazil and Hopscotch as [the biggest thing so far in developer tools in 2009](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/615208/whats-the-best-new-development-tool-of-2009). That's nice to hear, even if only in an answer to a question hidden away on a website whose regulars seem unlikely to vote it up.
