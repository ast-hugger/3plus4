Bob Westergaard [kicks off a post series about Smalltalk ports](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/bobw/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3352316147) he has done, with a teaser line:

> After some surfing the web, I found something that looked easy to to port. I'll leave that story for the next post.

I know where this is going, and it's very cool. Don't miss it. (The pressure is on, Bob!)
