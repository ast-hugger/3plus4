A recent question on vwnc reminded me of the notes on RB architecture and menu extensions I wrote a couple of years ago. Thanks to [Travis](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/travis/blogView), I got my hands on those notes and edited them into a semblance of an article. As the introduction says, these notes are becoming obsolete as the browser in VisualWorks changes. However, since I'm not aware of any other RB architecture overview, I hope this article will stay useful for some time. [Get it here](http://3plus4.org/files/Inside-the-RB.pdf).
