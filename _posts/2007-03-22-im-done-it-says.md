[![Good battery, yay!]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2007/03/good-battery-cropped.thumbnail.PNG)](http://blog.3plus4.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/good-battery-cropped.PNG "Good battery, yay!")I normally work on a Mac, but my "official" work laptop runs Windows (ok, it also has Linux on it) and I've been using it lately to be able to run Strongtalk. So I turn it on today and out of the blue pops up this message.

I think I'll just go home now.
