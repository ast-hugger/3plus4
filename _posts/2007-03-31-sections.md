<p>Today we are bringing together selectors as blocks from the last post and currying discussed before, to produce something pretty neat: sections.</p>
<p>We begin with an example. Using <code>asBlock</code> from the last post, we can write</p>
<pre class="smalltalk">
#&gt; asBlock</pre>
<p>to mean a block comparing two arguments. If we curry it with a number, say 42:</p>
<pre class="smalltalk">
#&gt; asBlock curried value: 42</pre>
<p>we get a one-argument block which, when invoked, tells whether 42 is greater than the argument. We could use it as a regular one-argument block, for example, with <code>select:</code></p>
<pre class="smalltalk">
#(1 20 50 43 11) select: (#&gt; asBlock curried value: 42)</pre>
<p>Of course, this by itself isn't particularly exciting. <code>[:each | 42 &gt; each]</code> would have done the same, and without excessive mental acrobatics.</p>
<p>Without being too concerned about the form for now, let's consider what we have just done by writing that expression. We took an operator (a binary selector) and produced a function (a block) which is an application of that selector to 42 on the left and the function argument on the right. In Haskell such a construct is called a <em>left section</em> of an operator. Similarly, a block applying #&gt; with 42 on the right and the argument on the left would be a <em>right section</em>. This is an interesting concept---apart from the unwieldy shape it had in our code. Let's fix that.</p>
<p>We add two methods to the system, one to the Symbol class, the other to Object.</p>
<pre class="smalltalk">
Object&gt;&gt;~ mustBeSymbol
	| block |
	block := mustBeSymbol asBlock.
	block numArgs ~= 2 ifTrue: [self error: 'invalid selector'].
	^block curried value: self

Symbol&gt;&gt;~ anObject
	| block |
	block := self asBlock.
	block numArgs ~= 2 ifTrue: [self error: 'invalid selector'].
	^[:a :b | block value: b value: a] curried value: anObject</pre>
<p>This defines <code>~</code> as a section operator. Sent to a symbol, it produces a right section, sent to anything else with a symbol as the argument---
a left section. We can now rewrite the example as

```
#(1 20 50 43 11) select: #> ~ 42
```

or to select the opposite

```
#(1 20 50 43 11) select: 42 ~ #>
```

This is more interesting than just currying (and can if fact be rewritten to not rely on currying). It will work for any binary or one-argument keyword message:

```
Transcript ~ #show:
```

is a block that writes its argument to the transcript.

```
#print: ~ foo
```

produces a block writing the printString of whatever was in the variable foo to the argument, which must be a stream-like object.

```
#, ~ ', hello!'
```

is a block that appends ', hello!' to the argument, and

```
'Hello ' ~ #,
```

prepends 'Hello ' to it. In general, we can think of a tilda as "stick the selector and the object together, and the object missing for this to be a complete message send will be provided when the block we create is called".
