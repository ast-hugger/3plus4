I'm presenting what I've been busy with for the past year and a half (well, almost) at Smalltalk Solutions in June. The title of the talk is "Interfaces without Tools".

> Programming environments are commonly built as sets of tools, where a tool has the shape of a pre-composed window displaying and manipulating a set of domain objects. This talk takes a critical look at that approach and presents Hopscotch, an application framework and development environment based on different concepts. Hopscotch is the IDE and the application framework of Newspeak, a new language and development platform inspired by Smalltalk and Self.

The talk is on the first day of the conference, June 19 at 1:30 pm.
